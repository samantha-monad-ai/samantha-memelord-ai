# 2. Problem Statement

As Web3 ecosystems scale, they often lose:

- Early cultural identity  
- Emotional bonding  
- Community lore & inside jokes  
- Organic engagement patterns  
- OG contributor recognition  

This results in:

- Reduced emotional attachment  
- Lower engagement depth  
- Surface-level community growth  

Infrastructure scales.  
Culture fades.
